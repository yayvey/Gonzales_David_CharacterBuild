            <h3 class="lb_heading">Jin</h3>

            <p class="lb_text">
                Jin uses orthodox Kenjutsu moves. Unlike Mugen, who uses improvisation and adaptation to win, Jin seems to rely on technical skill, on which he is extremely proficient. Jin is arguably one of the most accomplished swordsmen in the Samurai Champloo world, having survived crossing swords with Sara, Kariya Kagetoki, and Mugen. Although many of these battles have ended on an inconclusive note, his ability to survive the encounters with these individuals is a testament to his abilities.
            </p>

            <p class="lb_text">
                Although he seems incapable of picking up skills with the same ease as Mugen, he often learns about an opponent's philosophy in order to determine their strengths and weaknesses. Alternatively, Jin's reluctance to accept taking on new fighting styles may be related to the purist attitude Jin goes about with his own fighting style. It also sets him apart from Mugen, who readily copies his opponent's fighting styles and moves into his repertoire. Therefore, it could be argued that his clinical approach leaves very little margin for errors in observation and anticipation, making his fighting style a very notable foil against Mugen's.

            <h3 class="lb_heading">Fuu</h3>

            <p class="lb_text">
                Fuu is the daughter of Seizo Kasumi and an unnamed woman. During the Shimabara Rebellion (which was the uprising of Japanese Roman Catholics due to heavy taxes and abuses from officials), her father was one of the leaders in the rebellion. The Japanese sought the help of the Dutch army which helped quell the rebellion down and the Shogunate sought for Seizo's death.
            </p>

            <p class="lb_text">
                Fearing for his family's life, Seizo ran away to protect his wife and children where Fuu's last memory of him was running through a field of sunflowers. This is why she refers to him as "The Sunflower Samurai" or the "Samurai who smells of sunflowers." Without her father around to support them, Fuu and her mother led a difficult life until her mother died of illness and she worked under an elderly couple name Kikuzo and Ogin in a tea shop.

            <h3 class="lb_heading">Mugen</h3>

            <p class="lb_text">
                Mugen's highly unorthodox swordplay and a fighting style based on breakdancing - dubbed "champuru kendo" (Champloo Kendo in English) and ostensibly developed by himself - taking bits and pieces from all forms of martial arts and making up the rest on-the-go as he fights his opponents, make him generally unpredictable in a fight and a force to be reckoned with.
            </p>

            <p class="lb_text">
                Mugen also has a tendency to parry attacks with the steel base of his geta. He carries a uniquely crafted sword. It appears to be an amalgamation of the Okinawan sai with its tsuba being two upward-pointing and curved sideprongs, while the blade being smoothly curved like a Japanese katana, albeit with an edge on both sides. It is carried in a sheathe across his back with a double deception. The sheathe is disguised to make his normal-sized blade look like a nodachi in length, and the bottom end of the sheathe conceals a tant≈ç (only resorted to as a trump card).
