## I chose Samurai Champloo.

## Assignment Walkthrough

>I used the Marvel class build, and repurposed it to fit the theme of Samurai Champloo - updating the colours throughout (the
>header background colour, the red bumper bars, text colour etc)

>Chose a different theme for the page. Switched all the images around, and changed the lightboxes to fit the amount of characters I need.

>I played around with CSS, and discovered how to position images/text, set xyz's, make sprites function, and how to change colors.
>I created a sprite image for the characters of Samurai Champloo, and applied it to my assignment.

>I updated 3 lightboxes to show more content on click; I changed the background and cursor images for all lightboxes. 
>I edited the bannergif in premiere pro, and personally resized all the images/gifs used for uniformity.

>I went to the characters wiki's and pulled various descriptors as placeholder texts for the 3 lightboxes.

>I hope this is a well-written read-me.

##EDIT: 
>I changed all the gifs being used so I had a uniform quality. I changed the sprites I used to be able to fit properly on phone/laptop/desktop.
>I changed some of the id's to be more accurate (i.e red-bumper = black-bumper)
>I pull requested and approved multiple times (with one pull request before due date, showing a finished assignment), so all changes are trackable and can prove I did have it done before the due date. 
> Only changes after due date were vain, involving tiny value changes/higher quality content to use.
> Changed content due to recognizing websites process differently on different machines, perfectionist brain could not accept it.
> The structure of the build didn't change from the build sent before the due date.
