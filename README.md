## I chose Samurai Champloo.

## Assignment Walkthrough

>I used the Marvel class build, and repurposed it to fit the theme of Samurai Champloo - updating the colours throughout (the
>header background colour, the red bumper bars, text colour etc)

>Chose a different theme for the page. Switched all the images around, and changed the lightboxes to fit the amount of characters I need.

>I played around with CSS, and discovered how to position images/text and how to change colors.
>I created a sprite image for the characters of Samurai Champloo, and applied to to my assignment.

>I updated 3 lightboxes to show more content on click; I changed the background and cursor images for all lightboxes. 
>I edited the bannergif in premiere pro, and personally resized all the images/gifs used for uniformity.

>I went to the characters wiki's and pulled various descriptors as placeholder texts for the 3 lightboxes.

>I hope this is a well-written read-me.
